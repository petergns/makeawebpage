            While there are plenty of interesting places around the US, Washington D.C. offers an interesting city life,
            with plenty of cafes, cinemas, city parks, and museums to explore.
            Living around here for several years does make me homesick for New Zealand, once in a while,
            but it is an adventure in itself to be here, and to be able to explore another country.

          <p class="description-text">
            While I was studying at Victoria University of Wellington, I developed an interest in web design.
            But I always felt rushed, when I took the courses there, and a lot of the time,
            I would go from one project to another, with plenty of questions and some confusion.
            Usually this was because I wasn't given the time to learn at my own pace.
            Udacity gives me time to understand what I am learning,
            so I won't forget most of the things I have learned after I have finished the projects and quizzes.

          <p class="description-text">
            Computers connect together, in what is known as the web or world wide web.
            When you visit a web page such as udacity.com, your computer sends a request for information to a <b>'Server'</b>,
            which acts kind of like a phone book directing people to each other.
            This <b>'Server'</b> sends information back and forth to your browser, and allows you to view the web page.

      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">HTML</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          HTML or Hypertext Markup language is what we use to view and explore the web.
          This takes the form of HTML documents, which contain text,
          and a <b>'Markup'</b> that determines what the content of the page will look like once it is loaded.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-3">
      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">Tags and Elements</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          HTML documents are made up of <b>Elements</b>. We use <b>Tags</b> to tell the browser what elements will be used and in what way.
          If there is text on a web page for example,
          then you might like to use a <b>bold</b> tag on some important words,
          use the <em>italics</em> or em tag, or perhaps create a
          break between words or sentances with a
          <br><b>break</b> tag.

      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          Because when you put content into a computer, it will interpret exactly what you put in,
          even if it means that a program won't load correctly,
          which is why it is important to make sure that tags and elements of a program are correct
          before you ask a computer to load them.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-5">
      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          HTML elements fall into two categories, either <b>block</b> or <b>inline</b> elements.
          Block elements can take up the full width of a page, whereas inline elements cannot. For example, a <b>paragraph</b> or <b>p</b> tag creates a invisible box around content.
          Inline elements such as the <b>span</b> tag create an invisible inline box tightly <span>around content</span>.

            <figcaption class="image-caption">Structuring the web page</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="description-text">
            Using <b>Developer Tools</b> on <b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>, you can look at what makes a web page,
            in terms of how the HTML document is set up, and make modifications without
            having to make the changes directly on the web page itself.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            Using Developer Tools the tags can be altered, such as border-radius or color,
            to see what a change on the web page would do.
            This web page uses both border-radius and color, so it was helpful to use
            Developer Tools to test out what the page would look like,
            when I was putting it together.

      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          HTML documents are built much like a "tree", with HTML code branching out from each other,
          with <b>child</b> elements being the smaller branches,
          and the larger branches being <b>parent</b> elements.
          You can view the "tree" structure,
          and follow the branches from the body of the HTML,
          to smaller branches such as the <em>divs</em>,
          <em>classes</em>, and paragraph or <em>P</em> tags.

      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">Indentations and Boxes</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          When you look at an HTML page on a text-editor, you can see indentations,
          which go further and further in, this shows which element tags correspond to
          what content boxes. The further in the indentation, the more <em>nested</em> the box
          would be in that HTML document.

      <h3 class="concept-sub-title">Text Editors</h3>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          Programmers use Text Editors to write and organize their code,
          which enables them to develop codes quicker through use of the features
          that are provided. Through the use of Text-Editors like Atom, Sublime Text,
          and Notepad++ you can enable auto-formatting, and see codes easier than
          if using something basic like word or notepad or writing by hand.

          <p class="description-text">
            It is important while programming to not let areas slip into your code,
            as the computer will read those errors and not correct them when it loads your code.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            When the browser for example loads a web page, it will process the page as you have coded it,
            which means that if you don't add the correct tags or close them correctly, the page will be formatted
            not as you would want it to be formatted.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            Another problem is that you might repeat code, and thus make the code longer to process than it needs to,
            which will reduce the speed of an app or web page.
          </p>
          <p class="description-text">
            It also makes it harder to edit a page,
            as it is easier to edit a single div that covers multiple areas,
            than having multiple divs that do the same thing that you have to edit individually.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p class="description-text">
          <b>CSS</b> or <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> are much like the paint or style of a house,
          as you are adding aspects to your app or web page,
          that make it look more pleasing to the eye,
          or improve the user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          When you code with CSS and HTML,
          you can include a CSS style page to add color,
          different fonts, and more major changes,
          often through use of <b>classes</b>,
          which can be added to divs and other page tag elements.
